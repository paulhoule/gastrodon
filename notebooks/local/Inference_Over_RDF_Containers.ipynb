    "# Inference Over RDF Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In a <a href=\"http://ontology2.com/notebooks/local/RDFContainers.html\">previous</a> notebook,  I demonstrated queries and operations over RDF Containers,  one of two ways to represent ordered lists in RDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is motivated by my <a href=\"http://ontology2.com/essays/PropertiesColorsAndThumbnails.html\">analysis of XMP data</a> found on my computer.  XMP data uses Containers heavily,  so I need ways to work with them that roll off my fingers.  I felt the queries in the <a href=\"http://ontology2.com/notebooks/local/RDFContainers.html\">last notebook</a> were a little more complex than they needed to be,  so in this notebook I explore the use of inference to simplify queries and show a set of example queries that illustrate patterns for making queries against RDF Containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference is,  at root,  a simple concept.  Given some set of facts,  we can infer more facts.  In the case of RDF Containers,  we might have the fact that\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "?list rdf:_7 ?member .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and can infer that\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "?list rdfs:member ?member .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it easy to write a query such as \"*what lists is ?member a ?member of*\".  This particular example is simple and mechanical,  but more complex inference rules are used in business rules engines to answer questions such as \"*can we ship this product to that customer?*\" or \"*will we extend credit to this customer?*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works an example end to end,  including\n",
    "\n",
    "* how to write queries over RDF Containers without inference\n",
    "* two inference rules that simplify queries over RDF Containers\n",
    "* a simple inference engine based on SPARQL\n",
    "* a discussion of more complex inference engine\n",
    "* a cookbook of queries over RDF Containers"

    "SPARQL does not provide the typical functions for ordered collections,  such as counting the members (counting or not counting duplicates.)  Fortunately,  the implementation of RDF Containers is conceptually simple and it is possible to implement those functions based on first principles.  However,  this is one of the things you don't want to think about each time you write a query.  This article proposes two answers that work together to make queries against containers easier:\n",

    "1. A partial implementation of RDFS inference that simplifies queries over containers (and)\n",
    "2. A set of sample queries that explores the landscape and offers a set of patterns that can be used to write common (and not so common) queries\n",
